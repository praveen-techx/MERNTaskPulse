# 📋 TaskPulse – Simple MERN Task Tracker

TaskPulse is a minimal full-stack task management app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Update task status (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
- Delete tasks

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** – Database to store tasks
- **Express.js** – Backend API server
- **React.js** – Frontend UI (to be added)
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment

## 📁 Project Structure

```

/taskpulse
├── /server
│   ├── server.js
│   └── .env
└── /client (to be added)

````

## ⚙️ How to Run (Backend)

1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd taskpulse/server

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Add your MongoDB connection string in `.env`:

   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

4. Start the server:

   node server.js

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000

## 🔮 To-Do (Frontend)

* Set up React with Axios for task management
* Connect with backend routes
* Style with Bootstrap or Material UI
